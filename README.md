# 💫 About Me:
I’m currently working on  <br>- Strengthening core computer science fundamentals through my BCA program (2nd year), with a focus on Data Structures, Algorithms, Database Management Systems, Computer Networks, and Operating Systems.  <br>- Building small projects in Python and C++ to apply concepts like graph traversal, search/sort algorithms, and basic system utilities.  <br><br>I’m looking to collaborate on  <br>- Entry-level software projects involving algorithms, data structures, or problem-solving in Python or C++.  <br>- Academic or open-source projects related to DBMS schemas, networking simulations, or system utilities relevant to BCA coursework.  <br><br>I’m looking for help with  <br>- Designing scalable mini-projects that align with BCA subjects such as DBMS, Computer Networks, and Operating Systems.  <br>- Improving code quality, documentation, and best practices for academic and early-stage professional projects.  <br><br>I’m currently learning  <br>- Core BCA subjects including Data Structures and Algorithms, Database Management Systems, Computer Networks, Operating Systems, and Object-Oriented Programming.  <br>- Practical implementation of these subjects through coding exercises, algorithm analysis, and small-scale applications.  <br><br>Ask me about  <br>- Fundamentals of data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs) and basic graph algorithms like BFS and DFS.  <br>- How BCA core subjects connect to real-world applications and how to approach them from a beginner-to-intermediate level.  <br><br>Fun fact  <br>- Holds an ethical hacking certification while primarily focusing on strengthening foundational computer science skills through the BCA curriculum.<br><br>
